# hardware

There's no requirements to match the hardware; but some configuration options depend on hardware-specific settings that might not behave the same if not present.

* nVidia GPU (affects some Hyprland settings)
* Keychron K10 Pro, with [some keys remapped](hardware/keyboard/keychron-k10-pro-keymap.json) (notably, caps lock and ctrl are swapped)
* Logitech G502 X wireless mouse at 800 dpi (unfortunately, needs to be configured with G Hub on Windows)
