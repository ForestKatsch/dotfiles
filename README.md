# hardware

there's no requirements to match the hardware; but some configuration options depend on hardware-specific settings that might not behave the same if not present.

- nVidia GPU (affects some Hyprland settings)
  - `DP-1` 2560x1440 @ 144 (LG 27GL83A-B)
  - `DP-2` 3840x2160 @ 60 (Samsung U28E510D)
  - `DP-3` Valve Index / VR headset
- Keychron K10 Pro, with [some keys remapped](hardware/keyboard/keychron-k10-pro-keymap.json) (notably, caps lock and ctrl are swapped)
- Logitech G502 X wireless mouse at 800 dpi (unfortunately, needs to be configured with G Hub on Windows)
